# Notebooks

These notebooks were used to generate plots for our papers. 

Plots are stored in the `plots` and `dissertation-figures` directories.

__NOTE__: These notebooks were moved here from the parent directory. Some paths will be broken, and they won't know where to find the utility scripts in `../python`, as those were moved as well. 

## Missing Data

These notebooks rely on data that is too large to store in git. ~802GB of data was generated for this project. Please contact Patrick Lavin if you wish to access it.
